# üåç Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction using Machine Learning

Air pollution is a growing concern globally, especially with increasing **industrialization** and **urbanization**. It is crucial to monitor and predict **air quality in real-time** for the well-being of society.  
One of the most reliable measures to quantify pollution levels is the **Air Quality Index (AQI)**.  

In this project, we use **Python**, **Data Science tools**, and **Machine Learning algorithms** to **predict AQI** and gain insights into air pollution trends.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps in the Project
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values (using mean imputation).  
   - Removing extra spaces and empty columns.  
   - Importing essential libraries: **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understanding pollution trends.  
   - Visualizing AQI variations across time.  

3. **Modeling**
